# Advanced Flow Designer Features Epic

This epic focuses on developing advanced flow designer features with a modern and intuitive user interface. 

## Classes

- `FlowDesignerUI`: A class for building the user interface of the flow designer.
- `FlowComponent`: A base class for all flow components in the designer, with methods for adding, deleting, and editing components.
- `FlowCanvas`: A class for displaying the flow components on a canvas and handling user interactions, with methods for panning, zooming, and selecting components.
- `FlowPalette`: A class for displaying a list of available flow components that can be added to the canvas, with methods for filtering and sorting components.
- `FlowPropertyPanel`: A class for displaying and editing properties of selected flow components, with methods for validating input and updating the canvas.

## Methods and Properties

- `FlowDesignerUI.build()`: Builds the user interface of the flow designer.
- `FlowComponent.add()`: Adds a new component to the flow.
- `FlowComponent.delete()`: Deletes a component from the flow.
- `FlowComponent.edit()`: Edits the properties of a component.
- `FlowCanvas.pan()`: Pans the canvas in a certain direction.
- `FlowCanvas.zoom()`: Zooms the canvas in or out.
- `FlowCanvas.select()`: Selects a component on the canvas.
- `FlowPalette.filter()`: Filters the list of available components based on user input.
- `FlowPalette.sort()`: Sorts the list of available components based on user input.
- `FlowPropertyPanel.validate()`: Validates user input for a component property.
- `FlowPropertyPanel.update()`: Updates the selected component on the canvas with new property values.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- D3.js: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
- Material UI: A React UI framework based on Google's Material Design guidelines.

## Infrastructure

- Webpack: A module bundler for JavaScript applications.
- Babel: A JavaScript transpiler for converting modern syntax to older syntax for compatibility.
- ESLint: A linter for JavaScript code to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Design Patterns

- Model-View-Controller (MVC): A software architecture pattern for separating an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.
- Observer: A design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.
- Factory: A design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
